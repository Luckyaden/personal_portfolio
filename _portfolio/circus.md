During the DreamCorps Boot Camp, we had a project where we built a deck of cards using data structures such as arraylist, arrays and ect. Using Java, I created a deck of cards which allowed the user to traverse through the deck and return the cards the user wanted.Lastly for this project, I wrote a documentation of the code and steps of the code I created for this project. Here is the link to my github for this project on <a href="https://github.com/Luckyaden">Github</a> .
