During the DreamCorps bootcamp , we had project where were we build a deck of cards using data structures such as arraylist and ect. Using Java, created a deck of cards which allowed the user to traverse through the deck and return the cards the user wanted. Here is the link to my github for this project <a href="https://github.com/Luckyaden">Github</a> .
