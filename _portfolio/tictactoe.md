During DreamCorps Boot Camp, we had to create a mini-calculator that users can input their numbers using Java. These were the requirements for the project. As a User, I can enter integers and doubles into the calculator. Can add, subtract, multiply and divide the values I input into the calculator. Lastly , I can enter 3 values to be added, subtracted, multiplied or divided. We had to also create a code that will solve the issue of incase the user inputs zero when using division, since the outcome will be infinity. The way I solved this was by creating a loop with the condition that if a user inputs zero after a division operator, they will be asked to enter another number. This loop will keep current until the user stops entering zero. Also for this project, I had to consider the order of operation when it comes to calculation as I created the code for this project. Lastly, I wrote a documentation of the code and steps of the code I created for this project. Here is the link to my github for this project on <a href="https://github.com/Luckyaden">Github</a> .
