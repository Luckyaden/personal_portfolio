During DreamCorps boot camp , we had to create a project mini calculator: Created a mini-calculator that users can input their numbers using Java. These were the requirements for the project.As a User, I can enter int and doubles into the calculator.Can add, subtract, multiply and divide the values I input into the calculator.Lastly , I can enter 3 values to be added, subtracted, multiplied or divided.We had to also crate code that will solve the issue of incase the user inputs zero when using division , since the outcome will be infinity. The way , I solved this was creating loop with condition of if user inputs zero after a division opertaor , they will be asked to enter another number . This loop will keep currently until the user stops entering zero . Also this project, I had to consider the order of operation when it comes to calcuation , so I created a code of predmas.Lastly for this project , we has to create a documentions of the code and steps.Here is the link to my github for this project <a href="https://github.com/Luckyaden">Github</a> .
