Using an open source code from pluralsight, my first time using front end coding such HTML, CSS, and JavaScript . I built an ecommerce website, where customers can order pies. With the ecommerce website, I created an organized dropdown menu where customers could see pictures of the pie, descriptions, prices and created an effective checkout experience.The website was done using these three programming languages. Here is the link to my github for this project on <a href="https://github.com/Luckyaden">Github</a> .
