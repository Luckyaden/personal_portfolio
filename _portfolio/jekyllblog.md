During DreamCorps boot camp , we had to create a project where we will send Graduation progress notification. This notification will be a letter addressed to the student from the dean of their school informing the student of their graduation status and GPA using Java. We had to create a Student class. The user must input the following attributes:fullName,credits,gpa,school ,major and emailAddress.A student must have 120 or more credits and a gpa of 2.5 or greater to graduate.When a student reaches 60 credits they must declare a major if they have not.Finally ,all these requirement the output for the code would gradution notification letter. The letter  will be addressed to the student from the dean of their school informing the student of their graduation status and gpa. If the student has not yet declared a major, they should be reminded to do so if they have 60 or more credits.Lastly for this project , we has to create a documentions of the code and steps.Here is the link to my github for this project <a href="https://github.com/Luckyaden">Github</a> .
