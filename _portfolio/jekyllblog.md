During DreamCorps Boot Camp, I had to create a project where I sent graduation progress notification using Java. This notification will be a letter addressed to the students from the dean of their school informing them about their graduation status and GPA. I had to create a student class where I had to input the following attributes: full name, credits, gpa, school, major and email address. A student must have 120 or more credits and a gpa of 2.5 or greater to graduate. When a student reaches 60 credits, they must declare a major if they have not done so. Once these requirements were met the student would receive a graduation notification letter from their dean to inform them of their status.Lastly for this project, I wrote a documentation of the code and steps of the code I created for this project. Here is the link to my github for this project on <a href="https://github.com/Luckyaden">Github</a> .
