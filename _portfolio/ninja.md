During DreamCorps Boot Camp, our final capstone project was to create a streaming app similar to Netflix. We were put in groups to work on this project, and we also wrote documentations for it. For this project, we were tasked with creating a video management database application for the CW network. The database application contains a Model View Controller (MVC). The code for this database is separated into three packages: Model, Controller, and View. It also includes a folder called Assets that contains the .csv file and img files that will be referenced by the JVM. Lastly, for this project, I wrote a documentation of the code and steps of the code I created for this project. Here is the link to my github for this project on  <a href="https://github.com/Luckyaden">Github</a> .
