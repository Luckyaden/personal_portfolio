  During my internship at Target, my team worked with a client who runs the nonprofit World Encounter. World Encounter is a nonprofit organization that works with communities in Tanzania to empower women on financial stability. The organization loans women in these communitiesâ€™ capital loans to start up a business and become entrepreneurs who can provide for their families. The project that we worked on with the client is building a marketplace for their current website. We had to build a website where customers would be able to buy digital downloads and products from Tanzania. The profit will go towards the organization to lend out more loans and to keep it going. We had to integrate several technical tools such as Shopify, Leadpages, and Kindful to build this website for non-technical people. I learned a lot by collaborating with my teams, doing market analysis research and what technical tools to use and understanding code reviews as well.
