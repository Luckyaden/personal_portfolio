During my intership at Target , my team with a client who runs the nonprofit World Encounter. World Encounter is nonprofit organization that works with communities in Tanzania to empower woman on financial stability. The organization loans woman in these communities captial loan to start up an bussiness and become entrepreneurs who can provide for their families. The project that we worked on with client is building a marketplace for their current website. We had to build website where custumers would to able to buy digital downloads and products from Tanzania. The profit will go towards the organization to lead out more loans and to keep it going . We had to intergate severla technical tools such as shopfiy , leadpages and kindful to build this website for non-tehnical person . I learn alot by collabaorating with my teams , doing market analysis reserach , what technical tools to use and understanding code reviews as well. To checkout this project click here to view the
