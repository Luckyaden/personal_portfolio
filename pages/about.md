As I began my journey in the tech field, I knew it would take continued learning and dedication to become a software engineer. Individual projects completed during the bootcamp and my interships have taught me the value of problem-solving and creativity in software development. Being able to adapt quickly and learn new coding languages has given the chance to grow and broden my scope of technical skills. Taking the effort to do independent research, code reviews, learn how to read documentation, and do data structure implementation and iterate on my work have all proven to me that I can utilize my skills to enhance and improve any technological development in the future.

During times when I'm not learning coding or doing tech related materials. I like to spend time with my family and friends.Reading,painting and drawing are some of the hobbbies, I like to do during my downtime. I also  like to try pick up new skills. I'm currently learning new languages as it way to learn about different cultures and widen my perspective in life.I'm big foodie,so I'm always trying new foods around the Minneapolis. Even thought ,we can not travel at the moment I really enjoy traveling and immearsing myself into the culture of that country. I hope this helped get to know me little better on the personal and professional level.
