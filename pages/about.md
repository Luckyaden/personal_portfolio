As I began my journey in the tech field, I knew it would take continued learning and dedication to become a software engineer. Individual projects completed during the bootcamp and my interships have taught me the value of problem-solving and creativity in software development. Being able to adapt quickly and learn new coding languages has given the chance to grow and broden my scope of technical skills. Taking the effort to do independent research, code reviews, learn how to read documentation, and do data structure implementation and iterate on my work have all proven to me that I can utilize my skills to enhance and improve any technological development in the future.

I graduated from University of Minnesota with a bachelor in sociology and public health. Originally, I was on the pre-med route and was pursuing medical school and even worked at a private clinic after graduating from the U. However, during my gap year, I became interested in the tech field and began researching and that was how I became a software engineer through tech boot camp. During times when I'm not learning coding or doing tech related projects, I like to spend time with my family and friends. Reading, painting, and drawing are some of the hobbies I like to do during my downtime. I'm a big foodie, so I'm always trying new foods around Minneapolis. Even though we cannot travel at the moment, I really enjoy traveling and immersing myself into the cultures of the countries Iâ€™m interested in.
